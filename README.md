# us-counties-emissions-dashboard
Power BI dashboard with State Deep Dive, Top/Bottom counties, KPIs, and Emissions analytics.

Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption, GHG emissions, population, and per-capita environmental impact across all U.S. counties. The dashboard is inspired by a modern React UI theme (dark gradient, neon accents, glass effect), delivering a clean and analytical experience.
